### What is OpenYann?

OpenYann is intended to represent a modern Java compiler controller. In today's world, everything is becoming simpler and more minimalistic, which is exactly what this compiler controller is supposed to be. By default it uses vanilla javac which makes it Java version independent. In short, a simple, clean and time-saving type of CompilerController.

### Who is developing OpenYann?

In principle, anyone can and may contribute to OpenYann. I wanted to start the project (aredblock) because the discussion of the advantages of the different compilers (but also compiler controllers) is quite annoying and I wanted to create a new modern compiler controller.

### The code quality and spelling

I develop now for about 1.5 years with Java and accordingly is very warscheinlich the code style of me still expandable anyone who has any suggestions can very gladly contact me :3
